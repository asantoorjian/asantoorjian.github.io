what are some good professional looking ways to make a website for free?  this is for a children's book author. I want to display a page for books with images, links to third party retailers where the visitor can purchase the books, an about the author page, and a contact form (i believe there are free non server side ways to collect this info)
ChatGPT said:

Here are some of the best free, professional-looking options for a children’s book author site with your needs—book pages, buy links, about page, and a no-server contact form.
1. Free Website Builders with Professional Templates

These are easiest to set up and maintain—no coding required.
Platform	Pros	Cons	Contact Form Option
Wix (free plan)	Modern templates, easy drag-and-drop, book-specific layouts	Free plan has Wix ads, storage limits	Built-in form (stores data in Wix, email notifications)
WordPress.com (free plan)	Professional themes, great for blogs + author sites, highly customizable	Less visual editor flexibility than Wix	Use a free plugin like Formspree or Google Forms embed
Weebly (free plan)	Simple, fast to launch, mobile-friendly	Fewer template designs than Wix or WordPress	Built-in form works without a server
Google Sites (free)	Very easy to use, integrates with Google Drive	Less design flexibility, no fancy animations	Embed a Google Form easily
2. Free Contact Form Options (No Server Needed)

If you use a static site or a free plan without backend, these work well:

    Formspree – HTML form submission to your email (free for 50 submissions/month)

    Google Forms – Embed into your Contact page, stores responses in Google Sheets

    Tally.so – Free form builder, modern look, embeddable

    Netlify Forms (if hosting on Netlify) – Handles form submissions without a server

3. Recommended Approach for a Children’s Book Author

For a professional but easy free setup, here’s a good recipe:

    Pick Wix or WordPress.com – Both have free author templates and make it easy to add book images + retailer buttons.

    Pages to Include:

        Home/Books: Each book with cover image, short blurb, and "Buy" buttons linking to Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc.

        About the Author: Bio, photo, and optional fun facts.

        Contact: Simple form using Formspree or Google Forms embed.

    Custom Domain (Optional) – Even if free hosting is fine, consider buying a domain (e.g., yournamebooks.com) and pointing it at your free site for a more professional look (~$12/year).

4. If You Want More Design Control for Free

If you’re okay with a little more setup, you could:

    Use GitHub Pages + Static Site Generator (Jekyll or Hugo) with a free template for authors, then add a Formspree contact form.

    Benefit: Full control, no ads, and professional look.

    Downside: Slight learning curve.

If you’d like, I can give you specific template recommendations from Wix, WordPress, and Google Sites that would fit a children’s book aesthetic while still looking professional. That would save you hours of browsing. Would you like me to do that?

Tell me more about github pages and jekyll
ChatGPT said:

Awesome—GitHub Pages + Jekyll is a great way to get a polished, fast author site for free, with no backend needed. Here’s the quick tour plus a copy-pasteable starter you can use today.
What they are (in 20 seconds)

    GitHub Pages: free hosting for static sites directly from a GitHub repo. Automatic HTTPS, CDN, and versioning.

    Jekyll: a static site generator. You write simple Markdown files; Jekyll turns them into a full website using a theme.

Why this fits an author site

    Free & fast (no ads).

    Easy content editing: add a new Markdown file to publish a new book page.

    Themeable: pick a professional theme now, swap later without rewriting content.

    No-server contact forms: use Formspree/Tally embed.

Two setup paths
A) Zero-install (easiest)

    Create a GitHub account.

    Make a repo named yourusername.github.io (this creates a user site at that URL).

    In Settings → Pages, set the branch to main and folder to /root (if not already).

    Add an index.md file and you’re live in ~1–2 minutes.

    Later, switch on Jekyll by adding a theme and _config.yml (below).

B) Full Jekyll locally (more control)

    Install Ruby (comes preinstalled on macOS; Windows uses RubyInstaller).

    Terminal:

    gem install bundler jekyll
    jekyll new my-author-site
    cd my-author-site
    bundle exec jekyll serve

    Push the folder to GitHub, then enable Pages in repo Settings → Pages.

    Tip: If you don’t want to install Ruby, use GitHub Codespaces or GitHub Desktop. Both let you edit and publish without local setup.

Recommended themes for authors

    Minimal Mistakes (flexible, professional, lots of layouts)

    Beautiful Jekyll (simple + clean)

    Chirpy (blog/portfolio vibe with search)
    All support nav menus, blog posts, pages, SEO metadata.

To use a GitHub Pages–hosted theme quickly (no local build):

# _config.yml
title: "Alisha Santoorjian | Children's Book Author"
description: "Skijoring adventures with Zoe the Husky"
theme: minima   # swap for a supported Pages theme (minima is built-in)
# Optional niceties:
markdown: kramdown
plugins:
  - jekyll-seo-tag
  - jekyll-sitemap

Suggested structure for your author site

/ (repo root)
├─ _config.yml
├─ index.md                # Home: featured books + hero
├─ about.md                # About the Author
├─ books/                  # Book pages
│  ├─ whoa-zoe-whoa.md
│  └─ another-book.md
├─ _data/
│  └─ books.yml            # Centralized list of books (optional)
├─ assets/
│  └─ images/
│     ├─ whoa-zoe-cover.jpg
│     └─ author.jpg
└─ contact.md              # Formspree/Tally/Google Form embed

A quick “books” setup that scales
Option 1: simple pages (fastest)

Create one file per book in books/.

books/whoa-zoe-whoa.md

---
layout: page
title: "Whoa, Zoe, Whoa!"
permalink: /books/whoa-zoe-whoa/
cover_image: /assets/images/whoa-zoe-cover.jpg
retailers:
  - name: Amazon
    url: https://www.amazon.com/...
  - name: Barnes & Noble
    url: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/...
---

![Cover of Whoa, Zoe, Whoa!]({{ page.cover_image }})

A joyful skijoring adventure for ages 3–7—perfect for snowy day read-alouds.

**Buy the book:**
{% for r in page.retailers %}
- [{{ r.name }}]({{ r.url }})
{% endfor %}

Then link to it from index.md:

# Books
- [Whoa, Zoe, Whoa!](/books/whoa-zoe-whoa/)

Option 2: manage books as data (easiest long-term)

Put all book metadata in _data/books.yml:

- slug: whoa-zoe-whoa
  title: "Whoa, Zoe, Whoa!"
  blurb: "A light-hearted skijoring romp with Zoe the Husky."
  cover: /assets/images/whoa-zoe-cover.jpg
  retailers:
    - { name: Amazon, url: "https://www.amazon.com/..." }
    - { name: Barnes & Noble, url: "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/..." }

Then list them on index.md:

# Books
{% for b in site.data.books %}
### [{{ b.title }}](/books/{{ b.slug }}/)

![{{ b.title }}]({{ b.cover }})

{{ b.blurb }}

**Buy:** {% for r in b.retailers %}[{{ r.name }}]({{ r.url }}){% unless forloop.last %} · {% endunless %}{% endfor %}
{% endfor %}

Create a single book template books/template.md and duplicate per book or generate pages via a collection later if you want full automation.
Contact form (no server required)

Simplest: Formspree (free tier).

contact.md

---
layout: page
title: Contact
permalink: /contact/
---

Want to say hi, request a school visit, or talk shop?

<form action="https://formspree.io/f/your_form_id" method="POST">
  <label>Your name<br><input type="text" name="name" required></label><br><br>
  <label>Your email<br><input type="email" name="_replyto" required></label><br><br>
  <label>Message<br><textarea name="message" rows="6" required></textarea></label><br><br>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

_We’ll never share your info._

Alternatives: Tally.so or Google Forms (embed iframe).
(For Netlify Forms, you’d host on Netlify instead of GitHub Pages.)
Navigation & pages

Add a simple header/footer by using your theme’s navigation. For example with minima:

# _config.yml
minima:
  skin: classic
  social_links:
    - { platform: github, user_url: "https://github.com/yourusername" }
    - { platform: instagram, user_url: "https://instagram.com/yourhandle" }

# Create a nav include (varies by theme) or just link in pages:

Or just put links at the top of index.md:

[Books](/#books) · [About](/about/) · [Contact](/contact/)

Custom domain (recommended)

    Buy a domain (e.g., Namecheap/Google Domains).

    In GitHub: Settings → Pages → Custom domain → enter yournamebooks.com.

    Add DNS records (A or CNAME) as instructed. GitHub auto-provisions HTTPS.

SEO & analytics (quick wins)

    Add the jekyll-seo-tag and jekyll-sitemap plugins (already shown).

    In _config.yml, set title, description, and url: https://yournamebooks.com.

    Add Google Analytics or Plausible by dropping their snippet in your theme’s head include.

Accessibility & kid-friendly polish

    Use alt text for all images (book covers, author photo).

    Keep button/link text explicit (“Buy on Amazon” vs “Click here”).

    Large, high-contrast fonts; avoid tiny gray text.

    Compress images (1000–1600px wide is plenty; use JPG for covers).

Common “gotchas”

    Theme not applying? Make sure _config.yml is in the repo root and the theme: name matches a GitHub Pages–supported theme (or use remote theme config if building with Actions).

    Site not updating? Changes can take a minute; check Actions tab for build errors.

    Broken image paths? Use absolute paths like /assets/images/cover.jpg.

Want me to scaffold it?

I can generate a ready-to-publish starter (pages, config, book layout, contact form) that you can drop into a repo. Tell me your preferred theme (Minimal Mistakes / Beautiful Jekyll / Minima), author name, and one book title + cover image filename, and I’ll spit out the files.

what are some good jekyll themes for a children's book author's website?
ChatGPT said:

For a children’s book author site, you want a Jekyll theme that’s clean, friendly, and story-focused — but still professional enough to impress parents, educators, and publishers.
Here’s a curated list of free themes that work beautifully for your use case.
1. Minimal Mistakes

    Vibe: Polished, flexible, widely used

    Why it works for you: Can showcase books in grid or card layouts, supports image-heavy pages, and has built-in SEO + social sharing.

    Kid-friendly touch: You can add bright colors and playful header images while keeping the base structure professional.

    Demo: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/

    Notes: Highly customizable without coding; supports multiple navigation menus.

2. Beautiful Jekyll

    Vibe: Elegant, simple, easy to maintain

    Why it works for you: Quick to set up, built-in support for image banners on each page—great for showing a book cover as a hero image.

    Demo: https://beautifuljekyll.com/

    Notes: Perfect if you want minimal fuss and a blog section for updates, events, or behind-the-scenes posts.

3. Hydejack

    Vibe: Modern, sidebar-based navigation

    Why it works for you: If you want easy browsing between "Books," "About," and "Contact" without the user scrolling forever, Hydejack’s sidebar shines.

    Demo: https://hydejack.com/

    Notes: Personal edition is free; pro adds more layout options.

4. Lanyon

    Vibe: Minimal, fast, timeless

    Why it works for you: The clean design lets your illustrations and covers stand out.

    Demo: https://lanyon.getpoole.com/

    Notes: Best for authors who want speed and simplicity with no distractions.

5. Frisco (Remote Theme)

    Vibe: Bright, block-based sections

    Why it works for you: Naturally works as a one-page scrolling site—nice for mobile-first readers and parents.

    Demo: https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo (Indigo variant is also great for portfolios)

    Notes: Easy to adapt into a “Books” showcase + About + Contact layout.

6. Chirpy

    Vibe: Blog-meets-portfolio, modern typography

    Why it works for you: If you want to post news, events, or even free coloring pages, Chirpy’s blog system keeps them organized.

    Demo: https://chirpy.cotes.page/

    Notes: Great built-in search feature so parents/kids can find a specific title or topic.

7. Alembic

    Vibe: Lightweight starter theme

    Why it works for you: Barebones but pretty—it’s easy to layer your own playful fonts and colors without fighting the template.

    Demo: https://alembic.darn.es/

    Notes: Ideal if you want control over the look from the ground up.

Design tips to “kid-friendly” any Jekyll theme

    Typography: Use a rounded, easy-to-read display font for headers (e.g., Nunito, Baloo 2, or Quicksand from Google Fonts) and a clean serif or sans-serif for body text.

    Color palette: Pair a playful accent color (turquoise, coral, golden yellow) with a neutral base (white/cream background, charcoal text).

    Imagery: Feature book covers prominently, and use wide hero images on each book’s page for visual impact.

    Navigation: Keep menu items short and obvious — “Books,” “About,” “Contact,” “Fun Stuff.”

If you want, I can pick 2–3 themes from this list and mock up what your site structure would look like with your “Whoa, Zoe, Whoa!” book, an About page, and a Contact form so you can see them side-by-side before you commit. That would make choosing way easier. Would you like me to do that?
You said:
sure
ChatGPT said:

Great! I’ll mock up side-by-side starters for three themes—so you can copy/paste and be live on GitHub Pages quickly. Each includes: pages (Books, About, Contact), a book detail layout, buy buttons, and a no-server contact form (Formspree).
How to use these

    Create a repo named yourusername.github.io.

    Add the files shown for a theme below.

    Commit → wait ~1–2 minutes → your site is live.

    Replace placeholder text/URLs (noted inline).

Short blurb here.

**Buy:** [Amazon](https://amazon.com/your-book) · [Barnes & Noble](https://barnesandnoble.com/your-book)

about.md and contact.md same as Beautiful Jekyll examples (they’ll inherit Hydejack’s style).
Notes & nice-to-haves (apply to all)

    Images: keep covers ~1200px tall JPG; add good alt text.

    SEO: set meaningful title, description in _config.yml; the jekyll-seo-tag and jekyll-sitemap plugins are already included above.

    Buy buttons: you can swap the plain links for buttons using a tiny bit of HTML if you’d like.

    Custom domain: in repo → Settings → Pages add your domain; update _config.yml url:.

Which should you pick?

    Minimal Mistakes if you want a polished grid/card layout and the most flexibility without code.

    Beautiful Jekyll if you want a clean, simple site with the least setup.

    Hydejack if you love the sidebar navigation and a modern feel.

If you tell me which one you’re leaning toward, I’ll tailor the files (nav, colors, fonts, and a second sample book) specifically for “Whoa, Zoe, Whoa!” and your author bio so you can paste them in and be done.

how do you run "gem install jekyll bundler"
ChatGPT said:

Running

gem install jekyll bundler

means you’re using Ruby’s package manager (gem) to install two Ruby gems:

    jekyll → the static site generator

    bundler → manages Ruby gem dependencies for your project

Here’s exactly how to do it depending on your system:
1. Make sure Ruby is installed

    macOS: Ruby is preinstalled. Run:

ruby -v

If you see something like ruby 2.6.8 or higher, you’re good.

Windows: Install via RubyInstaller. Pick a version 3.0+ and check the box to add Ruby to your PATH during install.

Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev

2. Open your terminal / command prompt

    macOS → open Terminal from Applications → Utilities.

    Windows → open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

    Linux → open your distro’s terminal.

3. Run the install command

gem install jekyll bundler

If you get a permissions error on macOS/Linux:

sudo gem install jekyll bundler

(This installs them globally so you can use them from anywhere.)
4. Verify installation

jekyll -v
bundler -v

You should see versions like jekyll 4.3.2 and Bundler 2.x.x.
5. Create and run a Jekyll site

jekyll new mysite
cd mysite
bundle exec jekyll serve

Now visit http://localhost:4000 to see your site.

If you want, I can also give you a version of the install process that doesn’t touch your system Ruby at all, using GitHub Codespaces or a Docker container—this avoids most permission errors and is perfect if you’re just testing Jekyll. That’s often easier for first-time setups.

Do you want me to show you that approach?
You said:
how do you run "bundle add webrick"
ChatGPT said:

Running

bundle add webrick

tells Bundler to add the webrick gem (the small web server Jekyll uses for jekyll serve) to your project’s Gemfile.
This is often needed with Ruby 3.0+ because webrick isn’t included by default anymore.

Here’s exactly how to run it:
1. Make sure you’re inside your Jekyll project folder

Open your terminal, then:

cd path/to/your-jekyll-site

This folder should have a file called Gemfile.
2. Run the command

bundle add webrick

What it does:

    Adds a line like gem "webrick", "~> 1.7" to your Gemfile

    Runs bundle install to download and install it.

3. Verify it worked

You should see output confirming:

Fetching webrick ...
Installing webrick ...
Bundle complete!

And in your Gemfile you’ll now see:

gem "webrick", "~> 1.7"

4. Serve your Jekyll site again

bundle exec jekyll serve

It should now start without the LoadError: cannot load such file -- webrick message.

If you don’t have Bundler or a Gemfile yet (common if you just made a quick Jekyll site from GitHub Pages), I can walk you through creating one so bundle add webrick will actually work.

Do you want me to show you the quick Gemfile setup so you can run this command right away?

Hitchens	Serious prose, minimalist author sites	Typography-first design; search & feeds built-in

Choosing Between Serif and Author-Themed Options

    Stick with Serif if you love its business-oriented elegance but want a flexible layout for books, bios, and contact. It's versatile and polished.

    Try Hitchens or Long Haul if your priority is pure writing clarity and typographic beauty—great for emphasizing text over layout.

    Choose NorthendLab or Parsa if you want a blog-like interface with author-focused features like bios and post navigation, but still keep things visually appealing.

Next Steps

    Scaffold one of these author themes (Hitchens, NorthendLab, or Long Haul) with your books, About page, and Contact form?

You said:
I'm looking for ones that aren't blog focused
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you want Jekyll themes that aren’t blog-first, but instead feel more like portfolio or business sites where the homepage can highlight your books, author bio, and links without being dominated by a news feed.

I dug through the Jamstack Themes Jekyll directory and filtered out blog-centric ones. These are closer to Serif and the Elisha Cooper style you like: clean, image-forward, and navigation-driven.
Non-Blog-Focused Jekyll Themes for Authors
1. Serif (your current favorite)

    Demo: Serif Theme Demo

    Why it works: Minimal top nav, big visuals, “section” homepage structure. Ideal for “Books,” “About,” “Contact.”

    Notes: Easy to replace portfolio items with book covers.

2. Frisco

    Demo: Frisco Demo

    Why it works: Bold one-page scrolling layout, section-based. Great for author brand sites where each section (Books / Bio / Events) lives on the homepage.

    Notes: No blog feed—focus is on static content and visuals.

3. Agency Jekyll Theme

    Demo: Agency Theme Demo

    Why it works: Designed as a portfolio/business site. You can swap portfolio items for books, and keep “About” and “Contact” sections clean.

    Notes: Includes a built-in contact form layout.

4. Gravity

    Demo: Gravity Theme Demo

    Why it works: Lightweight, minimal, hero image focus. Lets you lead with a big banner and prominent buttons.

    Notes: Simple navigation; no blog section by default.

5. Simplefolio

    Demo: Simplefolio Demo

    Why it works: Single-page design with smooth scrolling; great for book covers, about, and contact in one cohesive flow.

    Notes: Originally for portfolios, but easily adapted for author showcase.

Key Difference from Blog Themes

These themes:

    Use static page sections rather than a chronological feed.

    Put visuals and fixed content first (perfect for book covers and illustration samples).

    Make the navigation predictable — visitors can go straight to “Books” without wading through posts.

If you want, I can take Serif, Frisco, and Agency and drop your “Whoa, Zoe, Whoa!” content into them so you can compare them live in GitHub Pages before you commit.

Do you want me to do that?
